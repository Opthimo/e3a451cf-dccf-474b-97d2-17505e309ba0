# Writing to the Terminal with GAS

## 1) Introduction

After learning how to exit a program via direct syscall ([link](https://github.com/STEMgraph/718193ef-11a1-408d-af23-4b10c24d490d)), the next step is to **write data to the terminal**.

In high-level programming languages, printing to the terminal is usually done with all kinds of different functions involving the verb _print_. These usually call the `printf()` function – a function from the C standard library (`libc`), which is available on most every operating system today. But deep below, this call ultimately ends up invoking the Linux syscall `write` (or equivalent on other platforms).

We can skip all libraries and **call `write` directly** from assembly by using the appropriate syscall number (`1`) and passing arguments in the correct registers.

### The syscall interface for `write` on Linux x86_64:

| Register | Purpose             |
|----------|---------------------|
| `rax`    | Syscall number (`1`)|
| `rdi`    | File descriptor (`1` for stdout) |
| `rsi`    | Pointer to the string buffer     |
| `rdx`    | Length of the string             |

Here's a minimal GAS program that prints `Hello, world!` to the terminal:

```gas
.section .data
message:
    .ascii "Hello, world!\n"
len = . - message

.section .text
.globl _start

_start:
    # write(stdout, message, len)
    mov    $1, %rax             # syscall: write (1)
    mov    $1, %rdi             # file descriptor: stdout (1)
    lea    message(%rip), %rsi  # pointer to the message
    mov    $len, %rdx           # length of the message
    syscall

    # exit(0)
    mov    $60, %rax            # syscall: exit (60)
    xor    %rdi, %rdi           # status code 0
    syscall
```

Assemble and run it.
This will print:

```
Hello, world!
```

Without using a high-level programming-language.

## 2) Tasks

1. **Change the Message**: Modify the string to print your name instead of `"Hello, world!"`.
2. **Add Two Lines**: Print two lines by using a second `write` syscall or by adding `10` (newline) at the right place in your data.
3. **Omit Newline**: Remove the newline and see how the output appears.
4. **Write to stderr**: Use file descriptor `2` instead of `1`. Observe the behavior.

## 3) Questions

1. What does the value `10` at the end of the message represent?
2. Why must the length of the message be provided manually in `rdx`?
3. What happens if the length is incorrect (too short, too long)?
4. Is it possible to write non-ASCII binary data using `write`?

## 4) Advice

Working without the C runtime helps build a concrete understanding of how programs interact with the operating system. By writing directly to stdout using the `write` syscall, you're learning how higher-level abstractions like `printf` are built. Always remember: You control the bytes — and the CPU just obeys.
